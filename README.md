This is a sample Spring Boot application that uses the Controller-Service-Repository pattern. I have made it to practice my basic Spring Boot understanding.

The available entities are: Category, Advertisement and User.

The supported HTTP Operations are GET and POST.

This table shows the endpoint calls that can be made to the application and the values of the HTTP Responses:

| Endpoint      | HTTP Operation | Returns       |
| :---          |     :----:     |          ---: |
| Header        | Title          | Here's this   |
| Paragraph     | Text           | And more      |
